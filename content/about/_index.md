I hold a PhD in Politics from Princeton University and am a member of the [Legal Form](https://legalform.blog) editorial collective. I use this site as a peg on which to hang my email address. I also blog on it at very irregular intervals.

You can contact me by email at `jrh[at]rhunter[dot]org`. I'm also on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jrobhunter) and [GitHub](https://github.com/jrhunter).
