I'm interested in the critique of law and the state, both as a contribution to the critique of political economy and as part of a broader critical theory of our inverted and topsy-turvy social world. I hold a Ph.D. in Politics from Princeton University, and I am a member of the [Legal Form](https://legalform.blog) editorial collective.

I am a member of the [Legal Form](https://legalform.blog) editorial collective. I use this site as a peg on which to hang [my email address](mailto:jrh@rhunter.org). I also blog on it at very irregular intervals.
