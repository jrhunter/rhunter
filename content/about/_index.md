I'm interested in the critique of law as a contribution to the critique of political economy as a critical theory of our upside-down social world. I completed a PhD in Politics at Princeton University with a focus on public law and normative political theory. I am a member of the [_Legal Form_](https://legalform.blog) editorial collective. I use this site as a peg on which to hang my email address. I also blog on it at very irregular intervals.

You can contact me by email at `jrh at rhunter dot org`. I'm also on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/selfactingmule) and [GitHub](https://github.com/jrhunter).

The source code for this site is available [here](https://github.com/jrhunter/rhunter).
