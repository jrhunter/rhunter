[Tune in](http://kpfa.org) at 12:00PM PDT to hear me talk with C.S. Soong on [*Against the Grain*](http://www.againstthegrain.org/) about the Supreme Court, [*Jacobin*](https://www.jacobinmag.com/), and why [liberal Court-worship means we can't have nice things](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2014/06/waiting-for-scotus/).

_Update_: You can listen to the audio on *Against the Grain*'s website [here](http://www.againstthegrain.org/program/1028/tues-102814-justice-justices).
