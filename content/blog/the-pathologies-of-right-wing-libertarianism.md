I have a new [essay](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/10/libertarian-liberal-gary-johnson-deliberation/) on the theoretical foundations of contemporary right-wing libertarianism up at [*Jacobin*](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/10/libertarian-liberal-gary-johnson-deliberation/):

> By elevating capitalist rationality above all other forms of social organizing, and by dismissing the public authority of democratic institutions as provisional and limited at best, libertarians advocate for conservatism, for capitulation to elites, and ultimately for the rejection of political activity. Libertarian political theory is in fact a potent form of anti-politics.
