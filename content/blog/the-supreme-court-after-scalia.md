I've written about the future of the Supreme Court after Scalia over at [*Jacobin*](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/02/supreme-court-antonin-scalia-death-nomination-bernie-sanders/). Here's a taste:

>We should not chase after the fantasy of exploiting Scalia’s absence to reconstitute a liberal-majority Court — and not merely because any possible Democratic president in 2017 is likely to lack the political support needed for successful judicial appointments.

>We should instead explore and promote options that would subordinate the Supreme Court to political control. Now is the right moment to dream of a chastened Court and to envision how that dream may become a reality.
