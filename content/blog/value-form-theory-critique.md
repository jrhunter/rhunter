notes

capitalism is historically unique because of self-expanding value
other theories of class society etc. are just ersatzes of bourgeois social thought

Postone on production vs. Uno school on circulation

my coinage: "labor bears the stamp of the value-form"

polarity, not duality, between essence and appearance

from Mattick, Jr.: discussion of a particular concept varies depending on whether you're talking about its essence or its appearance

This post is an introduction to value-form theory (VFT) and related tendencies in critical theory and the critique of political economy. It is meant to be a guide for the perplexed and curious, but it is also an opinionated and selective engagement with not one but several bodies of work. I should point out that I think that the term "value-form theory" is something of a misnomer. Few theorists who engage with the critique of political economy do so by focusing on value to the exclusion of all other determinations of capitalism. For this reason, I think it would better to use the phrase "social form theory." Most of those who are categorized as "value-form theorists" agree that Marx's critique of political economy is a _social form theory_.[^da61] (I will use the term "phrase" when no other seems appropriate, but let me emphasize that the narrowness suggested by the phrase fails to reflect the diversity and breadth of the authors and traditions to which it is often used to refer.)

Social form theory is distinguished by its insistence on taking the _critique_ of political economy seriously. Its rests on the insight that capitalism is distinguished by their historically specific social forms. Capitalist social relations are historically unique, not trans-historically valid. Despite what many of its defenders claim, capitalism is not an ideal and natural technique for ordering the creation and provision of wealth. It is true that societies featuring market exchange, class divisions, and uneven distributions of wealth have existed long before the advent of generalized commodity exchange---but those features are not sufficient conditions for considering those societies to be specifically _capitalist_.  **What distinguishes capitalism is not personal domination by _capitalists_ but abstract, impersonal domination by _capital_.** It is only in our own epoch that sociality as such is subsumed by self-expanding value. "Growth"---the endless accumulation of capital that is self-valorizing value---is the _sine qua non_ of our society and no other. This is a matter of social form: it is only in capitalism that labor bears the stamp of the value-form. Other accounts---including classical political economy as well as classical Marxism---also emphasize that capitalism is historically specific. However, as I argue below, such positions rest atop untenable claims about labor and wealth.

Capitalist society does in fact have a collective social purpose---the valorization of capital.

I hope to dispel a number of misconceptions about VFT. Let me note two of the most nettlesome at the outset. The first misconception is the claim that VFT either fails to discharge propositions about politics and struggle, or that it is quietist or nihilist. Critics of VFT

Second, VFT is often caricatured as an unhappy merger of neoclassical economics and Marxism, insofar as its critics claim that a central proposition is that value is "created" in exchange.

Finally, I hope to show





<!-- I suggest you cut these lines. Instead write 1-5 sentences on the difference between the two including the risk of seeing class struggle as you said in a PM re: Poulantzians and social dems. IIRC you said 'they tend to see class struggle as a zero sum conflict between two teams wearing clearly identifiable uniforms, and in which any distributive improvement for any worker is a step, however small, toward socialism.' Add why that view is mistaken in one line.

Then keep the next sentence but reword "the two pespectives" to "the view of capitalism as impersonal domination and capitalism as class struggle" -->

The critique of the form of value may seem obscure and technical, but it's important for critics of capitalism to understand. Marx's theory of value is an explanation of how capitalist society reproduces over time, despite its many contradictions and antagonisms. It is not a theory of prices or the quantitative measurement of specific values. Understanding this difference, and its significance, requires close attention to Marx's critique of political economy.

This is a provisional and messy post. I've tried to develop a relatively coherent and brief sketch of the key themes, claims, and conclusions in recent and contemporary theorizations of value---but that's all. This isn't a rigorous reconstruction of any particular line of argument; for the sake of brevity I am presenting a lot of claims without fully developing the many lines of argument that precede them. I'm less interested in trying to argue for a particular interpretation of Marx's theory of value than I am introducing "theory as critique" (to borrow Paul Mattick, Jr.’s felicitous phrase) and making the case that it is important and worth taking seriously. Thinking seriously about value has important (negative) implications thinking about emancipatory struggle.

Critical analysis of the value-form---often (rather unhelpfully) referred to as "value-form theory"[^7d82]---is not a theory of how prices are determined, nor is it a method for determining the magnitude of the value of this or that commodity. It is an explanation of the reproduction of capitalist social relations---that is, relations of domination, exploitation, and antagonism.[^f4ae] This is a puzzle that requires explanation. Most of us are separated from the means of production, such that we can only reproduce ourselves by purchasing commodities. This requires money, which can only be obtained through exchange. The only commodity that most people can bring to exchange is their capacity to engage in value-producing labor. And so despite the fact that most of us can only expect a tanning when we enter into the hidden abode of production, we did it anyway---because we must.

There is no single interpretation of Marx's theory of value which will satisfy every student of the _Neue Marxlektüre_, every contributor to systematic dialectics, every participant in the Conference of Socialist Economists. "Value-form theory" is an unrigid designator lacking a stable referent. Still, some widely (if not universally) shared commitments and conclusions can be outlined:

- **1. The explanatory importance of social forms:** Capitalism is distinguished from other modes of production by historically-specific social forms.
  - That is, capitalism's essential determinations (commodities, value, money, capital; the relation between capital and wage labor; the production and realization of surplus value; the subordination of human activity to the valorization of capital; impersonal domination through the public power of the bourgeois state) are not timeless principles. They are forms of social relations that have been contingently constituted in history.
  - Since these social forms are historically contingent, it is indeed that case that another world is possible. But the corollary to this is that the social forms constitutive of _this_ world must be abolished. Abolishing/transcending/sublating value is a necessary condition for communist society. Which means that:
- **2. Emancipatory social transformation and value relations are incompatible:** If, in a given society, it is the case that the law of value is still operative, that the value-form still mediates production (see below), that generalized commodity production still prevails (such that wants and needs can be satisfied only through purchases on the market)---then that society is not socialist.
  - "Abolish the value-form" doesn't really roll off the tongue or look snazzy on banners. But value theory isn't about giving tactical advice to those engaged in transformative struggles; it's a contribution to the critique of the society that is to be transformed. Quite simply, value theory in the first instance is a guide for What Not to Do When Sublating Capital.
  - It's worth noting that different theorists of value have different commitments and conclusions. "Value-form theory" is not simply the purview of any given tendency or school.
- **3. Anti-substantialism:** Value is a social relation (of universal exchangeability), not a physical property of commodities.
  - The notion that labor is embodied in commodities comes from classical political economy (especially David Ricardo), not its critique.
  - Per Marx, commodities' "objective character as values" is "purely social." Value "can only appear in the social relation between commodity and commodity."[^9cb4]
  - "Commodity fetishism" refers not to some kind of false consciousness but to the inverted and bizarre world of capitalist social relations: "Commodity fetishism is the form of appearance of particular social relations of production, but it is not merely an illusion. It really is the case that the relations between individuals and things are determinate, while the relations between particular people are accidental.…\[I\]t really is the case that social relations are mediated by relations between things. The illusion lies…in the belief that this social power derives from the commodity as a thing, rather than being seen as a particular form of alienated social relations."[^c8b5]
- **4. The centrality of exchange in the constitution of socially-necessary labor-time:** Exchange-value, appearing in money prices, conditions production by determining socially necessary labor time. The adequate form of appearance of the value of commodities, as universally-exchangeable portions of abstract labor, is money. Abstract, value-producing labor posits money-mediated exchange relations. In other words, the production of commodities possessing value---"the immanent (abstract, social, homogeneous) property of universal exchangeability"---is only possible because of money.
  - Money is not a mystification of value (_à la_ Ricardo); value cannot be constituted except through the mediation money. Abstract labor---that is, labor that produces commodities possessing value, such that they may be exchangeable with other commodities as homogeneous quantities of socially-necessary labor time---is a "real abstraction" constituted "behind the backs" of social individuals engaged in production and exchange.
  - "\[P\]rices are not a measure of embodied labour, but of the degree to which privately undertaken labour has been socially validated.…For Marx, money prices are the _only_ socially objective measure of value."[^89cb]
  - "Marx’s theory…argues the impossibility of knowing the abstract labor content of a commodity otherwise than by its price expression."[^fa04]
- **5. Money is an essential determination of capitalism, not an accidental property:** Without money, there would be no universal exchangeability of equivalents. Money is not a technical expedient (Ricardo's view), it is a core premise of the logic of capitalism.
  - There is considerable debate over "where" the constitution of value is precisely located---is it in production, in exchange, or both? I tend to think that Tony Smith has it right: value relations are "a package deal"[^2e56] and assigning primacy to any given determination is not the point of theorizing value. However, other theorists do place emphasis on various moments: some emphasize the production of surplus value, while others (notably Michael Heinrich) emphasize the money-form of value.
  - In any event, "value-form theory" is characterized by a certain minimum emphasis on money and exchange, if only in response to readings of Marx as a "minor post-Ricardian" labor theorist of value.
  - You want my opinion? The determination of value is not an iterative process starting with production and ending with exchange; it is a totality comprised of the simultaneity of all its constituent moments. It all hangs together---and it all falls apart otherwise. It is a testament to the awful durability of capitalist social relations that this totality _has_ hung together for so long.
- **6. The non-problem of the "transformation problem":** Money is the necessary form of appearance of the value of commodities. In the terms of Marx's theory of value, it is incoherent to claim that values need to be "transformed" into money prices. The latter are the only socially objective measures of the magnitude of value of commodities. It is incoherent to try to "transform" definite quantities of abstract labor into prices because prices are already the only adequate social validation of abstract labor.
- **7. Immanent critique as intertextuality, and _vice versa_:** Marx's critique of value must be reconstructed from many different texts---the many different drafts, editions, and translations of _Capital_, as well as texts such as the "economic manuscripts," the _Grundrisse_, "The Results of the Direct Production Process," etc.---not all of which perfectly cohere or agree with each other. Marx was not a prophet; he contradicted himself, made mistakes and false starts, and---_quelle horreur_---sometimes changed his mind about things.
  - One can't "learn Marx's view" simply by reading a single primary document, translated or otherwise. (This tends to stick in the craw of those who insist that Marx was somehow more-than-human and expounded a fully-formed, coherent doctrine over the course of his life.)
  - Moreover, there are gaps, contradictions, and ambiguities in Marx's theory. If the critique of political economy is to be a critical research program and not an ossified doctrine, then no outsized significance should be given to a given proposition just because it (seems to be) one of Marx's.

What are the alternatives to this view of the social form of production in capitalism? The foil for a lot of value theory is "left-Ricardianism"---the interpretation of Marx as a labor theorist of value who extended and refined Smith and Ricardo, rather than critiquing them immanently. Many critics and proponents of Marx alike understand him to have an embodied or (physical-) substantialist labor theory of value: the value of a commodity is the amount of socially-necessary labor required to produce it. (Critics tend to conveniently forget the "socially necessary" part and the role that social necessity plays in the regulation of total social production.) Value, on this view, is created by workers---and would properly be the possession of workers, but for the social, political, and legal domination of the capitalist class.

It's not hard to see the attraction of this labor-centric approach. It supports an account of exploitation with ready-made political appeal: the foundation of capitalists' wealth is the surplus labor extracted from workers---and this extraction is not only a manifest injustice, but the linchpin of capitalist social relations. Stop the exploitation of workers by capitalists, and you undermine capitalism. In the meantime, this view provides an attractive grid of intelligibility to actually-existing capitalist social relations: capitalism is a system of surplus theft in which "class struggle involves workers attempting to recapture a portion of the value created through their labor for their own use and enjoyment, while the capitalist class uses the state as an instrument to allow the continued ‘theft’ of the surplus."[^83a2] That is, the aim of the struggle against capitalism is the rectification of exploitation such that workers can retain "their" value. But it was Marx himself who said that to be a productive worker is "not a piece of luck, but a misfortune." There are greater misfortunes. But market dependency[^58b0] under conditions of generalized commodity production---the best that most people can hope for---is still quite bad.

Exploitation and expropriation are juridical categories, not just rhetorical cudgels. Marx is careful in _Capital_ to specify that exploitation as a category refers to the rate at which workers---who are subordinated to capitalists' control over production---produce value. The expropriation of surplus value is not theft; workers get a fair wage-price for what they sell to capitalists, which is not labor but labor-power---their capacity to engage in value-producing labor. Capitalists who hire wage-labor are not robbing their workers of "their" labor. Workers do not own abstract labor, only labor-power. Given their market dependency---they can only reproduce themselves by buying commodities, an activity that requires money---they are structurally compelled to sell their labor power "in installments"[^076a] as a commodity purchased by capitalists through the wage relation.

Workers aren't coerced by capitalists into allowing something to be stolen from them. They are compelled by market dependency to participate in the capital relation, in which they receive a fair wage-price for the commodity that they sell---their labor-power, their capacity to engage in value-producing labor. In the very Eden of freedom, equality, property, and Bentham, no individual capitalist (or agent of the state) forces any particular worker to enter or remain in the wage relation. The systematic, society-wide expropriation of surplus value rests atop subtle foundations of exploitation and domination, but it is not robbery at gunpoint.

What's more, the money form does not veil or obscure the expropriation of surplus value; it is integral to it. Value-producing labor can only assume social objectivity in the form of money and capital. Otherwise, not only is it unmeasurable---it can't even exist. Money is the necessary form of appearance of abstract labor. Essences cannot precede appearances. The production of commodities, being undertaken for the sake of selling them on the market, always already posits money-mediated exchange. These are moments in a totality, not steps in a sequence. Each moment is crucial. There's no generalized commodity production without the capital relation, without the monetary form of value, without primitive accumulation and market dependency reproduced through state violence, without any and all of the essential determinations of capitalism.

Revolution cannot come in the form of workers' control of value production, only the abolition of the social form of production in which workers produce value. The law of value asserts itself in any situation in which the aim of production is the self-expansion of value.[^1fa4] There can be no such thing as "socialist political economy" because the production and realization of value is always already capitalist, whether or not individual capitalists are involved.

The critique of value doesn't entail any particular politics. It's certainly not inherently opposed to working-class self-organization (despite "value-form theory" having acquired such a reputation in some quarters). "Abolish the value-form" sounds preposterously maximalist and abstract to some ears, but it doesn't have to be either of those things. Abolition as a social practice necessarily has specific appearances. You can't just do abolition. Any and all abolitionist projects are and will be heterogeneous in content and appearance, just like all social activity occurring in history rather than in recipes for the cookshops of the future.[^672f]

For many of the most influential contemporary analysts of the value-form, capitalism is better understood as a system of abstract and impersonal domination, rather than as (or only as) a form of class struggle. I don't expect that in the space of this short post I have fully persuaded anyone who adheres to the latter viewpoint that they should adopt the former. That may not even be necessary; for a provocative and generative collective attempt at a synthesis of the two perspectives, one should check out the Open Marxist tradition. In any event, critical inquiry requires getting inside of different positions and grasping their own logics, and it behooves those skeptical of a value-centric approach to at least take it seriously.

## Recommended Reading

As I said at the outset, this is a messy and provisional post; it's also heavily slanted in favor of my own preferred interpretations of (and contributions to) the theorization and critique of value. Not all of the works listed below agree with each other. As far as I'm concerned, that's the point of a critical research program.
