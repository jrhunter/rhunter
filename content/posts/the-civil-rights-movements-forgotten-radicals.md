I have a new essay up at [Jacobin](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/03/civil-rights-movement-bruce-ackerman/) on continuities of radicalism between the Civil Rights Movement and today's struggles against racism:

>However devoutly liberals may wish for it, democracy cannot be depoliticized. Political change can only be pursued and maintained by political commitment and engagement. The sacralization of the Civil Rights Movementâ€™s achievements through constitutional jurisprudence is the entombment, not the revivification, of the struggle for racial justice and equality.
