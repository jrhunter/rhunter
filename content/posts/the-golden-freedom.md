James A. Michener on federalism in [*Poland*](http://books.google.com/books?id=J_G0GVN8VpMC&lpg=PA132&dq=The%20Golden%20Freedom%2C%20which%20the%20magnates%20defended%20with%20every%20bit%20of%20chicanery%20and%20power%20they%20commanded%2C%20was%20the%20freedom%20of%20the%20few%20to%20oppress%20the%20many&pg=PA132#v=onepage&q=The%20Golden%20Freedom%2C%20which%20the%20magnates%20defended%20with%20every%20bit%20of%20chicanery%20and%20power%20they%20commanded%2C%20was%20the%20freedom%20of%20the%20few%20to%20oppress%20the%20many&f=false)

The Golden Freedom which the magnates defended with every bit of chicanery and power they commanded was the freedom of the few to oppress the many, the freedom of a few grasping  magnates to prevent a strong king from arising.
