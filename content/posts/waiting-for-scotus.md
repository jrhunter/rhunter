I have an [essay](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2014/06/waiting-for-scotus/) in the latest issue of [*Jacobin*](https://www.jacobinmag.com/) on liberals' preference for crafting policy through judicial review -- rather than pursuing political power through collective action. Liberals have not only abandoned mass politics by embracing the Court, but they have also turned their backs on the radical implications of the (partial and incomplete) successes of mass movements and the expansion of democracy in American political history. It's a fundamentally antidemocratic posture. Even more pathetically, it tends to fail even on its own terms.
