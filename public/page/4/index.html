As a tiling window manager, it automatically creates, adjusts, and moves windows for you so that you can focus on being productive. This means that it's equally useful whether you're using multiple large displays or a small netbook screen; it's also stable and consumes little by way of system resources.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/2012/04/12/switching-to-octopress/">
            <p class="note title">Switching to Octopress</p><p class="note date">Thursday, April 12, 2012</p><p class="note content">I recently switched from using WordPress to power my personal blog to Octopress, and my only regret is not switching sooner. Unlike WordPress, MoveableType, or other CMSes, Octopress doesn't require any MySQL processes running in the background, or futzing about with databases. It's a wrapper for Jekyll, which is a Ruby framework for generating blogs as static websites, which are secure, simple and fast.
The advantage of Octopress over Jekyll, from the perspective of a non-developer like me, is that it's simple and straightforward; all you have to do is download and deploy it with a minimum of fuss.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/2012/04/04/criticizing-judicial-supremacy/">

This has prompted a flurry of pearl-clutching and overblown criticism, much of it disingenuous and strictly partisan &ndash; which is of course not news.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/2012/04/03/against-political-stability/">

And those things which have long gone together are as it were confederate within themselves: whereas new things piece not so well, but though they help by their utility, yet they trouble by their incomformity. Besides, they are like strangers, more admired and less favoured. All this were true, if time stood still, which contrariwise moveth so round that a froward retention of custom is as turbulent a thing as an innovation; and they that reverence too much old times are but a scorn to the new&hellip;<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li></ul><div class="pagination">
