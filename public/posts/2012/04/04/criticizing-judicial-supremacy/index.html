    <h1 class="article title">5th Circuit Judge Thinks Criticizing Judicial Supremacy is Beyond the Pale</h1><p class="article date">Wednesday, April 4, 2012</p></section><article class="article markdown-body"><p>President Obama <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/03/us/politics/obama-says-hes-confident-health-care-law-will-stand.html?_r=1&emc=tnt&tntemail1=y">noted</a> on Tuesday that, were the Court to take the &ldquo;unprecedented&rdquo; step of striking down the Affordable Care Act (ACA) as unconstitutional, it would be engaging in exactly the kind of &ldquo;judicial activism&rdquo; that conservatives have been decrying for the better part of half a century. This has prompted a flurry of pearl-clutching and overblown criticism, much of it disingenuous and strictly partisan &ndash; which is of course not news. Obama <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2012/04/03/president-obama-talks-scotus-again/">clarified</a> that his point was that it would be unprecedented &ndash; unheard of since <em>Wickard v. Filburn</em> &ndash; for the Court to vitiate the modern understanding of the Commerce Clause in order to declare unconstitutional a law regulating the essentials of an industry that is essential to the American economy. If by &ldquo;judicial activism&rdquo; one means &ldquo;thwarting the will of democratic majorities&rdquo; &ndash; and this is what we've been told it is, by critics of the practice &ndash; then the Justices voting to overturn ACA would certainly look like activists.</p>
<p>What <em>is</em> news is that someone <em>has</em> reached for the ridiculous interpretation of Obama's remarks &ndash; that is, that he somehow said that judicial review itself is illegitimate &ndash; and, furthermore, that someone is Judge Jerry Smith of the 5th Circuit, who in a separate ACA case <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2012/04/03/dojs-homework-assignment-tell-fifth-circuit-whether-it-supports-judicial-review/">demanded</a> that DOJ lawyers write a report explaining Obama's remarks, clarifying whether or not he thinks that federal courts have the power of judicial review. (In a nice touch, he specified the length and spacing of the report as well.) It's not clear how Judge Smith thinks he has the jurisdiction to make such a demand, or why he thinks a political speech by the President is germane to his case. It will be interesting to see whether the Justice lawyers comply with this, well, <em>unprecedented</em> demand.</p>
