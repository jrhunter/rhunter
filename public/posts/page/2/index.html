            <p class="note title">Worse Regimes</p><p class="note date">Monday, March 30, 2015</p><p class="note content">Frances Stonor Saunders's impressive LRB piece on Eric Hobsbawm's file at MI5 is well-worth reading, but it ends with an odd coda:
 The two sides in the Cold War, finding each other irresistible, ended up in a contrapuntal relationship where, as George Urban put it, &lsquo;they marched in negative step, but in step all the same.&rsquo; They had their spies, we had ours. They had their files, we had ours.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/2015/03/23/the-civil-rights-movements-forgotten-radicals/">
            <p class="note title">The Civil Rights Movement's Forgotten Radicals</p><p class="note date">Monday, March 23, 2015</p><p class="note content">I have a new essay up at Jacobin on continuities of radicalism between the Civil Rights Movement and today's struggles against racism:
 However devoutly liberals may wish for it, democracy cannot be depoliticized. Political change can only be pursued and maintained by political commitment and engagement. The sacralization of the Civil Rights Movement’s achievements through constitutional jurisprudence is the entombment, not the revivification, of the struggle for racial justice and equality.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/2014/10/28/speaking-on-against-the-grain/">

Soong on Against the Grain about the Supreme Court, Jacobin, and why liberal Court-worship means we can't have nice things.

            <p class="note title">Abolish the States</p><p class="note date">Wednesday, August 13, 2014</p><p class="note content">&ldquo;Abolish the States,&rdquo; my polemic against federalism and &ldquo;states&rsquo; rights,&rdquo; is up at Jacobin. I've written before about how federalism frustrates freedom rather than promoting it. Federalism &ndash; the fragmentation of political authority and the preference for subsidiarity over national political equality &ndash; inhibits the consolidation of centralized political institutions and thwarts mass movements seeking comprehensive political change.
As a sort of colloquy on the topic, here are some choice quotes on federalism.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/2014/06/02/waiting-for-scotus/">

Liberals have not only abandoned mass politics by embracing the Court, but they have also turned their backs on the radical implications of the (partial and incomplete) successes of mass movements and the expansion of democracy in American political history. It's a fundamentally antidemocratic posture.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/2013/12/09/cyberlibertarianism-as-mystification/">
            <p class="note title">The Contradictions of Cyberlibertarianism</p><p class="note date">Monday, December 9, 2013</p><p class="note content">In an excellent essay recently posted at Jacobin, David Golumbia calls attention to the reactionary tendency of cyberlibertarian frames on digital culture and politics. Cyberlibertarians&rsquo; preference for viewing all political conflicts as computationally tractable tends to diminish the importance of political participation, and shrouds structures of power rather than illuminates them: &ldquo;computational practices are intrinsically hierarchical and shaped by identification with power.&rdquo; &ldquo;Hacktivists&rdquo; and digital utopians are practitioners of the kind of neoliberal antipolitics that elides questions of political antagonism in favor of adopting a managerialist posture.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/2013/08/20/surveillance-is-not-a-technical-problem-with-technical-solutions/">

She would rather be in the position of not having data to hand over in response to a &ldquo;National Security Letter&rdquo; should she ever be presented with one.
It's hard to fault Jones for acting on a healthy and justified fear of an unconstrained surveillance regime.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/2013/07/21/possibly-the-best-capsule-summary-of-political-economy/">

Political economy does not analyze the material-technical aspect of the capitalist process of production, but its social form, i.e., the totality of production relations which make up the &ldquo;economic structure&rdquo; of capitalism. &hellip; This distinction at the same time defines the method of political economy as a social and historical science. In the variegated and diversified chaos of economic life which represents a combination of social relations and technical methods, this distinction also directs our attention precisely to those social relations among people in the process of production, to those production relations, for which the production technology serves as an assumption or basis.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/2013/06/19/iain-banks-1954-2013-culture-novels/">
