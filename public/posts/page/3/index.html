Michener on federalism in Poland They were defending their freedom to neutralize the king; they were defending their freedom to keep the newly built towns subservient to their country areas; they were defending most strongly their freedom to keep their peasants in a state of perpetual serfdom as opposed to the liberties which were being grudgingly won in the western parts of Europe; and they were doing everything reactionary within their power to preserve the advantages they had against the legitimate aspirations of the growing gentry.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/2013/03/18/federalism-against-freedom/">
            <p class="note title">Federalism Against Freedom</p><p class="note date">Monday, March 18, 2013</p><p class="note content">I recently finished reading Peter Wilson's The Thirty Years War, and I regret that I didn't read it sooner. While the book has received no small amount of attention for its contributions to the history of warfare, or of Germany, or central Europe in general, it can also be read as an important contribution to constitutional theory. The study of the constitution of the Holy Roman Empire &ndash; here using the sense of the word &ldquo;constitution&rdquo; in its &ldquo;older&rdquo; sense, that is, as a package of values, norms, and institutions peculiar to a given political community &ndash; can, I argue, furnish insights that are valuable to the study of the constitutional order in the U.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/2012/12/12/sf-incluing-and-infodumps/">

I had that experience recently with a blog post defending the use of the expository tactics of &ldquo;infodumping&rdquo; and &ldquo;incluing&rdquo; in science fiction:

You can read all about the gory details elsewhere (it's worth noting that the ruling might not be that much of a setback to proponents of campaign finance reform); but here are my two cents:
First, the Court simply assumed its own facts and basically ignored the Montana legislature's findings of fact.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/2012/05/31/popular-constitutionalism-and-political-parties/">

The major parties in the contemporary U.S. are ideologically polarized and, currently, come closer now than they often have in the past to acting with parliamentary levels of discipline. (Well, alright, maybe only the Republicans are currently capable of acting with a high level of intra-party discipline, to the detriment of Senate comity and federal budget policy.)
We can complain about how (asymmetric) ideological polarization between the two parties is detrimental to democratic politics, to policy-making, to the state of political discourse, and so on.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/2012/05/29/constitutional-dysfunction-constitutional-criticism/">

It's a brisk and &ndash; characteristically for Levinson &ndash; entertaining cri de cœur about the need for reviving the &ldquo;democracy&rdquo; part of &ldquo;constitutional democracy.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/2012/05/09/capital-punishment-and-popular-constitutionalism/">

Unsurprisingly, my students weren't impressed with Furman&lsquo;s mélange of concurrences supporting (for different reasons) the per curiam holding that the capital sentencing in the case was cruel and unusual. In general, students are drawn to absolutes and decisiveness. They want exceptionless rules, unambiguous standards, and, all in all, an ordered universe of constitutional law. To their minds, Furman is a muddle, and Gregg&lsquo;s clarification of its reasoning is scant improvement.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/2012/04/27/past-and-future-popular-constitutionalism/">

As the title suggests, Engel is more concerned with political leaders acting from within and on behalf of political institutions, parties, and coalitions, and not so much with mass movements on behalf of constitutional change or maintenance (but more on that later).<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/2012/04/24/the-ninth-amendment/">

Many students tend to be chary of Douglas's &ldquo;penumbras&rdquo; and &ldquo;emanations,&rdquo; which they see as Lochnerizing &ndash; substantive due process rearing its ugly head. They see Goldberg's reasoning as the more restrained option, in fact: they think that because he hangs his hat on the Ninth Amendment, he has a firmer textual basis for his argument than Douglas, who relies on a structural reading of the relationships between, and implications of, different rights guarantees, precedents, and principles.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/2012/04/19/another-lesson-on-the-difficulty-of-reconciling-judicial-supremacy-with-democracy/">

This liberty, despite not being mentioned by name in the Constitution's text (which conservatives usually think matters in determining whether or not something is a legitimate liberty interest), has allegedly been under constant assault by &ldquo;a democratic process&rdquo; that Brown considers beholden to unnamed &ldquo;powerful groups.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li></ul><div class="pagination">
